<h2>FM.24.08 Pre-Registration IS CLOSED</h2>
<h3><a href="/2008/route.html">ROUTE</a> | <a href="/2008/info.html">INFO</a></h3>
<p>Hi! This is the official registration form for FM.24.08.  All fields are required and all teams wishing to confirm their spot in the event this year must fill out this form and pre-pay. We may have space for on-site registration, but don't count on it!</p>
<p>Your team leader must register the entire team at once!</p>
<p>Please fill out all fields and submit the form.  Within the next 24 hours you will receive an invoice via e-mail to pay for your slot. You must pay before the deadlines below to confirm your spot and the amount you must pay is based on the date you pay, NOT the date you register so register early!</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost per person before September 1st is $15 + ~50cent processing fee</li>
<li>Cost per person before September 5th is $18 + ~50cent processing fee</li>
<li>Cost per person on race day is $20</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have paid, there are no refunds for any cancellations, team member drop outs, or any other reason. We race rain or shine.</p>

<p>We _may_ schedule a time for someone to be at Johnny's Pizza for ~2 hours one evening if you wish to pay in person to avoid the online processing fee (or if you are afraid of the internets). Check the FM24 forums on fastermustache.org for any payment times!</p>

<p>Once you have registered, you will receive a digital race packet with information on parking, transportation, facilities, sag, etc</p>

<P>If you have any questions, email 24@fastermustache.org</p>
