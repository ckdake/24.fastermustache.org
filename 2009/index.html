<h3>To be scheduled</h3>
<ul>
<li>Some point events will happen at specific times or within specific time frames. These will be posted here at the start of the event, and will be in your information packet.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<div>
<h2>The Rules</h2>
Event Organizers and Elliott St can kick you out of the event for any reason, so don't give us a reason to do so. Reasons for being kicked out of the event include but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Breaking any laws (traffic laws, vandalizing property, etc)</li>
<li>Cheating (falsafying point competition entries, visiting checkpoints in some other way than taking your teams RFID card to each one by riding a bicycle, etc)</li>
<li>Not following any Event Organizers' instructions. </li>
</ul>
Event Organizers have the final say on everything. We've very rarely had to use this power and pretty much everyone has a fantastic time every year, so if we ask you to do something or not do something, please just listen to us!
<br />
You do need to have front and rear lights, a bell, and a helmet.
</div>

<div>
<h2>Some other little things</h2>
<ul>
<li>No Refunds.</li>
<li>The Event ocurs regardless of the weather. It's never rained, but it's been real hot and real cold!</li>
<li>Each team gets 1 RFID card.  First replacement is $10, second replacement is $25, no further replacements will be provided. Each card has a small hole in it for a lanyard, etc, but you cannot put any more holes in it. It's useful to bring something to attach to your card to make it easier to get at.</li>
<li>Tap "START" right before you go out on your lap, visit each checkpoint in order and tap your card there, and tap "FINISH" right when you complete your lap. This way you can take a break between laps, and still have accurate lap times.</li>
<li>Each team is responsible for themselves. There is no organized mechanical, medical, or emergency support.</li>
<li>Working front and rear lights are required by law and by us. Helmets are required by us.</li>
<li>Parking information will be provided in the team packet you receive when you check in at the event.</li>
