          then registration is the day of the relay (Saturday morning at 9:00am.) 
          All members do not need to be present at the start of the relay (we realize 
          some people may be working during the span of 24 hours), but all riders 
          must have signed the liability form to ride. And each rider must complete 
          at least one lap for your team to be considered legitimate.</p>

        <p class="gentext"><strong>What is Faster Mustache?</strong></p>
        <p class="gentext">Faster Mustache is an independent organization made 
          up of a diverse group of Atlanta residents with one thing in common: 
          riding bicycles. Fixed or free, geared or single, cruiser, chopper, 
          racer, clunker, we ride 'em. Our interests are as diverse as our riders 
          but we are all dedicated to promoting safer riding conditions in Atlanta 
          and being ambassadors for Atlanta's road bicycle community. </p>
