<h1>what you're in for</h1>
<p>FM.24.06 is a 24 hour relay through the streets of Atlanta.  Gather a team of 4-6 riders and pass the baton through grueling traffic, up insane hills, and through dark alleys to complete laps for prizes.  Faster Mustache, in conjunction with Johnny's Pizza and a host of sponsors, offers the most exciting weekend of urban cycling of the year and a chance to be crowned the king or queen of the streets!
