        <p>RULES:</p>
        <p class="gentext">GENERAL<br>
          1. all riders will follow the route shown on the back of their spoke 
          card. this is the official route and must be respected unless there 
          is a complete blockage and an alternate route must be taken. in this 
          event, please contact one of the ride organizers.<br>
          2. all riders will stop at the dessignated waypoints and pick up a ticket 
          during their route lap. these tickets must be collected in order for 
          your lap to be counted as valid. accidentally forgetting or any other 
          bullshit excuse will not be respected. for your lap to count, you must 
          have 3 waypoint tickets.<br>
          3. all riders MUST check-in at the end of each lap. the rider may then 
          continue on or tade off with a team member.<br>
          4. before you leave the check-in to ride a lap, you must make it apparent 
          to the current staff that you are leaving for an official lap and not 
          for a casual cruise around town. the current staff will be keeping track 
          of who is riding when. this is a safety percaution.<br>
          5. all riders MUST display their team number on their body or bike at 
          all times while riding<br>
          6. each team may only have one rider completeing laps at any given time<br>
          7. dont try to cheat. its not cool. much of this is on the honor system. 
          you will be disqualified without refund or free food if you are found 
          cheating.<br>
          8. if you see another rider has been hit or is injured you MUST stop 
          to help. this may be a relay but each rider is more important than your 
          pride.</p>
        <p class="gentext">OTHER<br>
          1. each rider will register by 11:00am and will have signed the liability 
          waiver and paid in full. NOTE - ALL RIDERS DO <span class="links">NOT</span> 
          HAVE TO BE PRESENT AT THE TIME OF THE BEGINNING OF THE RACE, BUT THEY 
          MUST HAVE PAID AND SIGNED THE LIABILITY RELEASE FORM<br>
          2. each team will choose their first rider, and have him/her ready to 
          ride at 11:30am<br>
          3. all participants not riding are welcome to remain at 97 Estoria. 
          if you piss off the employees at 97 Estoria and are asked to leave their 
          property, you will be disqualified from the relay. <br>
          4. all participants will abide to the requests of the 97 Estoria staff.<br>
          5. you may not park a car and leave it for 24 consecutive hours in the 
          97 Estoria parking lot. additional parking is avaliable in the A&amp;P 
          lofts lot just a few blocks away.</p>
        <p class="gentext">more rules to come as we think of them</p>
        <p class="links">LAP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</p>
        <p class="gentext">The lap management system we are using consists of 
          various waypoints along the route in which you will be required to get 
          off your bike, open a &quot;newspaper dispenser&quot; and take a ticket. 
          There will be a combination lock on the dispenser to prevent non-participants 
          from tampering with the relay. You will take a ticket from each waypoint 
          and at the end of every lap you will drop them off at the check-in table. 
          Do not try and take more than one ticket. The numbering on the tickets 
          allows us to track each person's actions and any gap in the numbering 
          will show that you have cheated. So at the end of every lap, you will 
          have several tickets, one of each color, to hand in at the staff table. 
          The locations of the dispensers and the combination codes to get in 
          them will be avaliable on the back of your spoke card. <br>
          <br>
          We understand that there are many routes you could possibly take to 
          reach the various waypoints. Because there is no waypoint in a certain 
          location does not mean you may create your own route. YOU MUST ALWAYS 
          FOLLOW THE GIVEN ROUTE. This is based on the honor system, and if you 
          see somone cheating, please let the staff know. This is a friendly, 
          community building event and we have no room for dishonest assbuckets.</p>
        <p class="gentext">Thats it for now. All this information and more will 
          be on an information sheet you will get at registration time. Please 
          email with questions/comments.</p>
